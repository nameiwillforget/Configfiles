The config files for my keyboard configuration and emacs. The configuration uses the synergy between several different levels:

1. [dual-function-keys](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/dual-function-keys) is a program that allows you to change the function of a key depending on whether it is tapped or held. I use it for several things:

	1.1. Holding Space functions as Ctrl.

	1.2. I've put the Shift-functions on the keys next to the Shift-keys because I found the Shift-keys hard to reach (note that I have a German keyboard where the	left Shift-key is shortened to make space for another key).

	1.3. The 2, 3, 4 and 5 keys are used for Alt-Tabbing and Ctrl-Tabbing. The 4-key is configured to function as Alt when held and as the "Windows-key" (left-compose) when tapped, the 2-key sends a Shift-Tab key-combination when tapped, the 3 and 5 keys are configured in xkb to function as Tab and as Ctrl respectively. For some reason though the 2-key always goes back two entries when used in this way. I don't know what that's about.

	1.4. Most other keys in the vicinity of the resting position of my hands function as modifiers when held, which allow me jointly to access all eight xkb-layers without ever having to press two keys.

	1.5. Most of them also send out keycodes when tapped that induce modifiers in emacs.

`dual-function-keys` has some problems: in particular
